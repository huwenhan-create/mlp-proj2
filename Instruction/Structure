1. Introduction:
    (1)task: Create a predictive model to forescast when a booking will be canceled. --> outcome of interest: `is_canceled`
    (2)data: outcome and variables --> instinctively analyze [according to the real life and common sense]

2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:
    (1)Basic: missing value, abnormal values(optional)
    (2)Advanced: univariable analysis, Colinearity analysis, association study
    (3)Visualization: Distribution, relationship
    (4)Feature: One-hot, polynomial, combine and seperate --> reduce the dimensions.

{
Function:
    1. property_analysis(y): explore the properties of the target feature.
    2. association_analysis(x,y): relationship between outcome of interest and the feature.
    3. Information_Gain(x,y): Compute the Information gain using `gini`
    4. data_transform(X): Do the fransformation
    {
        Structure:
        1. drop_features
        2. standardized_feature
        3. Onehot or Label
    }
} 

{
    drop: 'year','month',...
}


3. Model Fitting and Tuning
    (1)Fit the model (logit, SVM, Decision tree, LDA) --> Classification
    {
        Model compare: Why we choose?
        Model fit: What we choose?
    }
    (2)compute the scores
    {
        Model evaluation: the performance of our model
    }
    (3)model selection and Tuning
    {
        Model tunning: Gridsearchcv -> better model
    }

4. Discussion & Conclusions
    (1)Model explaination: display the results
    (2)Advantages and disadvantages
    (3)Provide some suggestions
    (4)Discussion: improvement and adjustment
