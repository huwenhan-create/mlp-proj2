1. Introduction:
    (1)task: Create a predictive model to forescast when a booking will be canceled. --> outcome of interest: `is_canceled`
    (2)data: outcome and variables --> instinctively analyze [according to the real life and common sense]

2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:
    (1)Basic: missing value, abnormal values(optional)
    (2)Advanced: univariable analysis, Colinearity analysis, association study
    (3)Visualization: Distribution, relationship
    (4)Feature: One-hot, polynomial, combine and seperate --> reduce the dimensions. 

3. Model Fitting and Tuning
    (1)Fit the model (logit, SVM, Decision tree, LDA) --> Classification
    (2)compute the scores
    (3)model selection and Tuning

4. Discussion & Conclusions
    (1)Model explaination: display the results
    (2)Advantages and disadvantages
    (3)Provide some suggestions
    (4)Discussion: improvement and adjustment
